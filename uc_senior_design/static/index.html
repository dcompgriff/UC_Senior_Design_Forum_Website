                    <p>In this paper we investigate the use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
                    (ROC) curve (AUC) as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms. As a case study we 
                    evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer 
                    Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six “real world” 
                    medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional 
                    overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to 
                    overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error 
                    that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; 
                    and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that 
                    AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for “single number” evaluation of machine learning 
                    algorithms.</p>

                    This paper was about universal decoding, sort of. THe idea is that the decoder doesn’t 
                    know the codebook but it knows the encoder is using a random block code. However, it doesn’t 
                    know the rate, even. The question is really what can one say in this setting? For example, 
                    symmetry dictates that the actual message label will be impossible to determine, so the error 
                    criterion has to be adjusted accordingly. The decoding strategy that they propose is a partition 
                    of the output space (or “clustering”) followed by a labeling. They claim this is a model for 
                    clustering through an information theoretic lens, but since the number of clusters is exponential 
                    in the dimension of the space, I think that it’s perhaps more of a special case of clustering. 
                    A key concept in their development is something they call the minimum partition information, 
                    which takes the place of the maximum mutual information (MMI) used in universal decoding 
                    (c.f. Csiszár and Körner).</p>
